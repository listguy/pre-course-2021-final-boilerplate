# Pre Course Finals Project - Todo List ðŸ“‹

My attempt at an To-Do list webpage.

## Features

- Add tasks with text, creation date, due date, and priority.
- The tasks list is dynamic - items are editable, and can be removed.
- Your list is safe! the items are stored as *JSON* at jsonbin.io, and can be accessed anywhere, fully persistent!
- Sort your items by priority, creation date, or due date - ascending or descending.
- Dark mode for the comfort of your eyes available, should be detected automatically based on system option.

- Change this file (README.md) and style it to showcase your solution (gifs, explanations, link to the github page, links to resources you used, etc...)
- Submit your solution repo to the [ChallengeMe](http://challengeme.suvelocity.org/) system
- Submit your repo link and github page and video to Google Classroom
- Record a 5-10 min selfie video, describe yourself in a few words (age, location, military background, technological background). Also, talk about the solution you submitted (try to explain how your app works in general and which bonuses you added). Think about this video as an interview.

GOOD LUCK!
